    	<strong>Why is Online Marketing Essential for Every Restaurant?</strong> 
<p>Because now more than ever people are turning to the web to discover new restaurants, submit reviews, and seek peer recommendations.</p>

<strong>What Every Restaurant Should Know About Online Marketing</strong>
<p>That there are four components required for an integrated and successful online marketing strategy: Local Search, Website Design, Social Media, and Review Sites.</p>

<strong>Local Search</strong>

<p>Smart phones and mobile devices have become the go-to resource for people trying to decide where to dine and drink when they are on the go.</p>  

<p><em>Can people find your restaurant when they search from their computer or mobile phone?</em></p>

<strong>Website Design</strong>

<p>An effective restaurant website is simple, concise, and leaves the visitor with a positive impression of the restaurant's food and atmosphere.</p> 

<p><em>Does your website convince potential customers to visit your restaurant?</em></p>

<strong>Social Media Marketing</strong>

<p>Effective social media management will shorten the time in-between each customer visit to your restaurant, and motivate word of mouth advertising.</p>  
	
<p><em>Are you effectively using social media to harness word-of-mouth advertising?</em></p>

<strong>Review Sites and Reputation Management</strong>

<p>Review sites are arguably the most important component of online marketing.  The better looking your reviews, the more likely people are to come in and dine.</p>  

<p><em>Does your restaurant have positive reviews online?</em></p>
