		<h2>The Social Element Process</h2>

			<p><b><em>Phase 1:</em></b></p>

<strong>Evaluate</strong>
<p>Every account begins with a Social Audit. The Social Audit measures the online presence of
a business in four key areas: Social Media, Online Search, Review Sites, and Website. The initial Social
Audit acts as a benchmark for future assessments.</p>

<strong>Discover</strong>
<p class="borderbottom">Becoming acquainted with the brand. This includes researching the target market, identifying
the competition, and listening to conversation surrounding the brand.</p>


<p><b><em>Phase 2:</em></b></p>

<strong>Strategize</strong>
<p>A strategic social media plan is formed. This is the map and directional for your business's
online presence. The strategy will identify the primary social media goals, outline a plan of action, and
identify which metrics to track for measuring effectiveness.</p>

<strong>Optimize</strong>
<p class="borderbottom">A keyword list is generated based on the research and strategy. The keywords will be
planted into the brand's social media platforms, review sites, online directories, and website. This will
make the business more searchable online, which in turn will create more exposure.</p>

<p><b><em>Phase 3:</em></b></p>

<strong>Setup</strong>
<p>Acquire access to all existing online accounts and create accounts for platforms that the
business does not already possess. Each platform is optimized and updated to Social Element standards.</p>

<strong>Launch</strong>
<p>Social media management begins! We start implementing the posting schedule determined
by the strategy. Each platform is monitored and managed entirely by us from here on out! This includes
the creation of engaging posts, updating each platform, responding to users, monitoring reviews and
conceptualizing campaigns when necessary.</p>

<strong>Measure</strong>
<p class="class">A simple monthly report is delivered to measure progress and determine areas of focus for
the upcoming month. A more comprehensive and all-encompassing report is delivered bi-annually.</p>
