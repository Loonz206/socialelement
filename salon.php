        <strong>Why is Online Marketing Essential For Salons &amp; Spas?</strong> 
<p>Because people are increasingly turning to the web to find salons and spas in their area and to browse user reviews.</p> 

<strong>What Every Salon and Spa Owner Should Know About Online Marketing</strong>
<p>That they must concentrate on the following four components to build a successful online strategy: Local Search, Website Design, Social Media, and Review Sites.</p>  

<strong>Local Search</strong>

<p>Smart phones and mobile devices have become the go-to resource for people looking for a salon or spa while they are on the move.</p>  

<p><em>Can people find your salon when they search from their computer or mobile phone?</em></p>

<strong>Website Design</strong>

<p>A successful spa/salon website provides all the essential information in a clean and concise manner.  This includes contact information, list of services, and staff biographies.</p>

<p><em>Does your website convince potential customers to visit your salon or spa?</em></p>

<strong>Social Media Marketing</strong> 

<p>Effective social media management will increase the frequency at which each customer visits your spa or salon and ignite word of mouth advertising.</p>  

<p><em>Are you effectively using social media to spread word-of-mouth advertising?</em></p>


<strong>Salon and Spa Review Sites and Reputation Management</strong>

<p>Review sites are arguably the most important component of online marketing, especially when it comes to salons and spas.  Positive reviews build trust and encourage business!</p>
