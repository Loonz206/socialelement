    	<h3>Social Media Packages</h3>


<p>Social Element has designed the following industry specific social media packages.  If your business does not fit into one of these industries, don't worry.  Contact us and we will put together a package that is right for your business.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media for Restaurants and bars</strong></p>

<p>When people are looking for a place to grab a bite or enjoy a cocktail, they most commonly will hop on the internet and do one or all of the following: Search for a place nearby using Google, refer to Yelp and browse reviews, and/or look for a friend's recommendation on Facebook.   

Unfortunately, if your restaurant or bar does not show up on the first page of major search engines, have favorable reviews, or have a reputation on popular social media platforms…chances are pretty good that people searching online will not find or visit your business.</p>  

<p><strong>Social Media for Salons and Spas</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to hair and physical appearance, people don't mess around.  That is why those who are in the market for a new hair style, eyebrow wax, or spa treatment, are likely to spend time on major review sites like Yelp when looking for the right salon or spa. 

Social Element's Social Media Package for Salons and Spas is designed to help your business shine online.</p> 


<p><strong>Social Media for Health and Fitness Providers</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to health and fitness providers, people want the best they can get.  Whether you are dentist, chiropractor, or yogi, or health club owner, having a strong online presence is the key to growing your business.   

Why?  Because most people do online research and/or look for recommendations before deciding on a health or fitness provider. 

Social Element has designed a social media package for health and fitness providers to encourage a positive community around your business, motivate online recommendations, and make your business easier to find online.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media for Nonprofits</strong></p>

<p>With all the nonprofits out there, it is sometimes difficult to break through the clutter and share your story with the world.  Social media and nonprofit fundraising platforms are a great way to break through…but it is very time consuming project to keep up and most organizations just don't have the time or expertise.

That is why Social Element has built a Social Media Package specifically priced and tailored for nonprofits.  This package will help tell your story, inspire, and ultimately raise more money for your cause.</p>
